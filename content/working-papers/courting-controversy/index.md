abstract: Some accounts of US Supreme Court decisions like Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization paint Chief Justice John Roberts as an ardent institutionalist, seeking a middle way to protect the Court's legitimacy; but what if there was another dynamic at play? A strand of the judicial politics literature argues politicians may offload the responsibility for enacting controversial policies to the courts, either because they do not have the leeway to enact their preferred policies or to avoid electoral consequences. These analyses often only consider the direct policy payoff to judges. However, as the aftermath of Dobbs shows, controversial decisions can impact citizens' voting intentions, even when made by the courts. I use a game theoretic model to explore the conditions under which multimember courts will enact controversial decisions that may have electoral consequences for their ideological allies in the legislature.
