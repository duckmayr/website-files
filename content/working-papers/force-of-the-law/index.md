abstract: '(How much) does “the law” affect judges decisions? Though among the most fundamental of questions in judicial politics, the effect of the law is difficult to identify. A number of past studies have taken clever approaches to tackling this difficult question; however, they offer mixed findings at best, and are sometimes critiqued on methdological grounds. I provide new evidence by taking a new perspective on the law: I conceptualize the law as the mapping from cases to outcomes implied by all past court decisions. I use that perspective to develop a strategy that exploits attributes of Gaussian process classification to isolate the effect of the law on judges’ votes from the effect of judges’ own preferences. I apply this strategy to data on First Amendment Free Exercise cases at the U.S. Supreme Court. I find the justices exhibit varying levels of deference to the implications of past decisions, with some justices showing substantial effects and others essentially unaffected. In addition to providing the best available evidence of the constraining effect of law, I provide a measure of the legal status quo, an important theoretical concept in judicial politics, and highlight past studies’ vulnerability to misspecification bias, a problem my modeling strategy also solves.'
