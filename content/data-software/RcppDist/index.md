abstract: RcppDist provides header-only C++ library with functions for additional statistical distributions that can be called from C++ when writing code using Rcpp or RcppArmadillo. I had occasion to draw up the C++ code for these distributions on various projects, and rolled them all together into an R package and got it up on CRAN so no one else would have to.

RcppDist provides header-only C++ library with functions for additional statistical distributions that can be called from C++ when writing code using Rcpp or RcppArmadillo. I had occasion to draw up the C++ code for these distributions on various projects, and rolled them all together into an R package and got it up on CRAN so no one else would have to.

You can find it [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppDist), and you can find the development version on [my GitHub](https://github.com/duckmayr/RcppDist).
