bggum provides R tools for a Bayesian approach to estimating Generalized Graded Unfolding Model (GGUM) [(Roberts, Donoghue, and Laughlin 2000)](https://doi.org/10.1177/01466216000241001) parameters. For more information on the GGUM and our MC3 estimation algorith, please see my paper with Jacob Montgomery, ["Ends Against the Middle: Measuring Latent Traits When Opposites Respond the Same Way for Antithetical Reasons"]( {{< ref "publication/ggum" >}}).

You can find it [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bggum), and you can find the development version on [my GitHub](https://github.com/duckmayr/bggum).
