Many of the most important political debates today involve the structure and powers of the federal government. This course provides an introduction to federal constitutional law, focusing on the institutional powers of the federal government. After an introduction to the American judicial system and methods of constitutional interpretation, we discuss judicial review, the powers of the branches of the federal government, and the relationship between the states and the federal government.
